# Advanced Multithreading


## Introduction
In this assignment, you are given three problems focused on various areas of multithreaded programming. Solve each exercise according to the provided guidelines.


## Objectives
- Review the concepts of multithreaded programming and utilize them correctly
- Research Pi calculation algorithms
- Familiarize yourself with the Semaphore, CountDownLatch, and BigDecimal classes
- Learn the basics of writing a proper project report


## Tasks
1. Fork this repository and clone the fork to your local machine. Ensure to create a new Git branch before starting your work
2. Complete the following exercises based on the instructions provided:

   - `Calculate Pi`: Calculate the value of Pi up to 1000 digits after the floating point. Find 
     more instructions in the `PiCalculator` class.
   - `Semaphore`: Solve a synchronization problem using a Semaphore that allows 2 threads to enter the critical section.  Find more instructions in the `Controller` class.
3. Write a comprehensive report on the assignment.


## Notes
- You can find unit tests for the `Calculate Pi` exercise. Use these to ensure you've implemented the code correctly.
- You are NOT allowed to use any other synchronization tool for the `Semaphore` exercise. Only Semaphores may be used.


## Report
You are expected to write a detailed report on the assignment. This is the most important task 
expected of you, and over 50% of the assignment's final grade depends on it. Explain the 
solutions you chose for each exercise but try to focus on the `Calculate Pi` problem.
<br>You MUST include the following details in your report:
- The solutions you chose for each exercise and how you implemented them
- All mathematical algorithms you tried and used for the `Calculate Pi` problem
- Details on the final algorithm you chose for calculating Pi and its advantages over other algorithms
- Explanation regarding Semaphore and its use cases
- All References and Resources (include links where possible)

Your report can either be in the format of a PDF or Markdown file (Markdown is preferred). 
Including graphs, charts, and other appropriate visuals can grant bonus points.



## Evaluation
- Your code should compile and run without any errors
- Your code should be well-organized, readable, properly commented and should follow clean code principles
- Your code should pass all the provided unit tests
- You should use Git for version control and include meaningful commit messages
- Your report should be as comprehensive as possible


## Submission
1. Add your mentor as a contributor to the project.
2. Create a `develop` branch for implementing features.
3. Use Git for regular code commits.
4. Push your code and your report to the remote repository.
5. Submit a pull request to merge the `develop` branch with `main`.


The deadline for submitting your code is Friday, May 17 (28th of Ordibehesht). Good luck!
