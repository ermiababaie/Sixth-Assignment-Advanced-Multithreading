#### the number π is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.14159. The number π appears in many formulae across mathematics and physics. It is an irrational number, meaning that it cannot be expressed exactly as a ratio of two integers, although fractions such as 22/7 are commonly used to approximate it.

## how to calculate pi? :memo:

### Buffon's needle problem : :game_die:
 in probability theory, Buffon's needle problem is a question first posed in the 18th century by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. The answer to this problem can be used as an approximate solution to obtain the pi number.
#### pros and cons: This formula is not easily simulated by the computer and is not suitable for calculating the pi number

### Nilakantha's formula : :open_book:
    (π-3)/4 = 1/2*3*4 - 1/4*5*6 + 1/6*7*8 - ...
#### pros and cons: This formula is easy to implement to calculate pi, But for the number of digits more than a thousand, it requires a lot of calculations and It has low accuracy

### Chudnovsky algorithm : 
##### The Chudnovsky algorithm is a fast method for calculating the digits of π, based on Ramanujan's π formulae. Published by the Chudnovsky brothers in 1988, it was used to calculate π to a billion decimal places.
##### It was used in the world record calculations of 2.7 trillion digits of π in December 2009, 10 trillion digits in October 2011, 22.4 trillion digits in November 2016, 31.4 trillion digits in September 2018–January 2019, 50 trillion digits on January 29, 2020,[8] 62.8 trillion digits on August 14, 2021, 100 trillion digits on March 21, 2022, and 105 trillion digits on March 14, 2024
